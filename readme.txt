Assign and display times alongside the announcement dates in Timeline Express announcements.

== Description ==

When active, the Timeline Express - Date - Time Add-On will hide the default announcement date field, and generate a date and time field for you to use.

Multiple announcements that have the same date & time will fallback to use the published date to dictate order on the timeline.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the entire `timeline-express-date-time-add-on` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. If you previously had announcements setup, follow the migration steps.
4. Create a new announcement set a date & time and set the date format for each announcement.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What if multiple announcements have the same dates? =
If multiple announcements use the same date and time, then the announcement 'published' date will be used to dictate the order. The published date can be adjusted just above the 'Publish' button in the right hand sidebar on the announcement creation/edit screen in the dashboard.

= Can I set the display format? I don't want to display the time on some announcements. =
Yes! For each announcement you have the ability to choose how the dates are displayed. Out of the box you can display the dates in the following formats:

- Full Date (ie: 02/10/2018 1:00 PM)
- Year Only (ie: 2018)
- Date Only (ie: 02/10/2018)
- Time Only (ie: 1:00 PM)
